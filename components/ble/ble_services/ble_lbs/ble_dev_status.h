 *
 * @brief LED Button Service Server module.
 *
 * @details This module implements a custom LED Button Service with an LED and Button Characteristics.
 *          During initialization, the module adds the LED Button Service and Characteristics
 *          to the BLE stack database.
 *
 *          The application must supply an event handler for receiving LED Button Service
 *          events. Using this handler, the service notifies the application when the
 *          LED value changes.
 *
 *          The service also provides a function for letting the application notify
 *          the state of the Button Characteristic to connected peers.
 *
 * @note The application must propagate BLE stack events to the LED Button Service
 *       module by calling ble_dev_status_on_ble_evt() from the @ref softdevice_handler callback.
