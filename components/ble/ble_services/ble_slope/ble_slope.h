 * @ingroup ble_sdk_srv
 * @brief slope Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the slope Service with the slope Level characteristic.
 *          During initialization it adds the slope Service and slope Level characteristic
 *          to the BLE stack dataslopee. Optionally it can also add a Report Reference descriptor
 *          to the slope Level characteristic (used when including the slope Service in
 *          the HID service).
 *
 *          If specified, the module will support notification of the slope Level characteristic
 *          through the ble_slope_slope_level_update() function.
 *          If an event handler is supplied by the application, the slope Service will
 *          generate slope Service events to the application.
 *
 * @note The application must propagate BLE stack events to the slope Service module by calling
 *       ble_slope_on_ble_evt() from the @ref softdevice_handler callback.
 *
 * @note Attention! 
 *  To maintain compliance with Nordic Semiconductor ASA Bluetooth profile 
 *  qualification listings, this section of source code must not be modified.
