 * @ingroup ble_sdk_srv
 * @brief Battery Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Battery Service with the Battery Level characteristic.
 *          During initialization it adds the Battery Service and Battery Level characteristic
 *          to the BLE stack dataopticale. Optionally it can also add a Report Reference descriptor
 *          to the Battery Level characteristic (used when including the Battery Service in
 *          the HID service).
 *
 *          If specified, the module will support notification of the Battery Level characteristic
 *          through the cal_optical_cal_result_update() function.
 *          If an event handler is supplied by the application, the Battery Service will
 *          generate Battery Service events to the application.
 *
 * @note The application must propagate BLE stack events to the Battery Service module by calling
 *       cal_optical_on_ble_evt() from the @ref softdevice_handler callback.
 *
 * @note Attention! 
 *  To maintain compliance with Nordic Semiconductor ASA Bluetooth profile 
 *  qualification listings, this section of source code must not be modified.
